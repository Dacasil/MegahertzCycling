## Abstract
Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) is a powerful experimental technique that
captures real-time snapshots of ultrafast structural dynamics in materials using a
pump-probe approach. Ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (UTEM) combines
a highly coherent electron beam with simultaneously high spatial and temporal
resolution, providing an ideal setup for time-resolved measurements. A recurring
challenge in these measurement schemes is the limited brightness of pulsed electron
beams. One addresses this limitation by increasing the pump laser repetition rates.
However, a critical complication arises from the cumulative heating of the sample
at high repetition rates and fluences. Here, this challenge is addressed by means
of a sample design with improved thermal properties. The best sample design is
determined by testing various configurations of the transition metal dichalcogenide
1T’-TaTe2 in a UTEM setup. Due to its low-temperature structural transitions, 1T’-
TaTe2 is suitable for thermal investigations. Ultimately, a sample design was created
that made it possible to perform time-resolved experiments at 2 MHz repetition rate
and 10 mJ/cm2 fluence. This new sample structure provides a solution for advancing
ultrafast dynamic studies in ultrafast science.
